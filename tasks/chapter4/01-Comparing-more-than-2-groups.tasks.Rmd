### Quick tasks

Let us now consider the `quine` data again. Use both the F test as well as the Kruskal-Wallis test to decide if the number of days of absence differs between age groups. 

```{r}
library(MASS)
myfit <- lm(Days ~ Age, data = quine)
anova(myfit)
kruskal.test(Days ~ Age, data = quine)
```
